🎬 SCENE 1: THE HOOK (0:00 - 0:20)
Visual: The Dashboard is on screen. "Normal" Mode (Green/Dark colors).
Action: Do not move the mouse yet. Let the viewer absorb the UI.
Say: "DeFi has an 800 million dollar problem. When real-world disasters hit—like a drought destroying coffee crops—blockchains are too slow to react. Arbitrage bots drain the liquidity pools before the price updates.
We built Agri-Hook: A hostile infrastructure layer on Flare that weaponizes the FDC to trap these bots and protect farmers."
🎬 SCENE 2: THE SETUP (0:20 - 0:40)
Visual: Start moving the mouse.
Action:
Hover over the Left Column (Farmer).
Hover over the Wallet Balance.
Click the "Connect Wallet" button (top right).
Metamask Popup: Select Account -> Connect.
Say: "On the left, we have the Farmer's View. This represents João in Brazil. He has tokenized his crop and paired it with FBTC (FAsset Bitcoin) to earn yield.
On the right, we have the Protocol War Room. Currently, the weather is verified as 'Normal' by the FDC. The trading fee is a standard 0.01%."
🎬 SCENE 3: THE EVENT (0:40 - 1:00)
Visual: Focus on the Right Column (Protocol).
Action:
Move mouse to the "FDC Weather Oracle" card.
Click the Toggle Switch: "⚠️ ADMIN: SIMULATE DROUGHT".
Metamask Popup: Click Confirm. (Edit out the waiting time in post-production).
UI Reaction:
Screen borders turn RED.
Status changes to "CRITICAL DROUGHT".
Chart: The Orange line (Oracle) spikes up vertically.
Fee: Changes from 0.01% to 50.00% (Pulsing Red).
Say: "Now, let's simulate a crisis. The FDC consensus confirms a severe drought in Minas Gerais.
Look at the chart. The real-world price (Orange) instantly gaps up.
Usually, a bot would exploit this gap. But Agri-Hook detects the FDC signal and instantly spikes the swap fee to 50%, essentially freezing the pool for predatory flow."
🎬 SCENE 4: THE TRAP (1:00 - 1:25)
Visual: Focus on the "Arbitrage Defense System" card.
Action:
Click the button: "🤖 SIMULATE BOT ATTACK".
UI Reaction:
A "Toast" notification pops up: "⛔ TRANSACTION INTERCEPTED. TAX APPLIED."
The "Treasury Value" number counts up (e.g., from 10,000 to 15,000 FBTC).
The Terminal log updates: > [HOOK] MEV Captured. Funds sent to Vault.
Say: "Here comes the bot. It tries to buy the cheap tokens.
Instead of blocking it, our Uniswap Hook allows the trade but forces the bot to pay the full arbitrage gap as a fee.
We just captured the bot’s profit and moved it into the Insurance Treasury."
🎬 SCENE 5: THE PAYOUT (1:25 - 1:50)
Visual: Focus on the Left Column (Farmer).
Action:
Move mouse to the "Claim Payout" button. (It should now be glowing/enabled).
Click "Claim Payout".
Metamask Popup: Click Confirm.
UI Reaction:
Confetti animation.
Wallet Balance increases.
Status badge changes to "PAID".
Say: "Now, the loop closes. Because the FDC verified the drought, the Insurance Vault unlocks automatically.
João clicks claim. The Smart Contract verifies his GPS hash and the weather data, and streams the captured bot revenue directly to his wallet in Bitcoin (FBTC)."
